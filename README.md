### Hi there üëã I am a software engineer specializing in multiple programming technologies including JavaScript, React/Redux, Node/Express, MongoDB and Flexbox.
I am familiar with C#, C++, Java, .Net packages, and SQL. I have practice in game/logic engines, data modeling and web development requiring abstract problem solving, extreme detail orientation, and a strong foundation in software engineering principles on a variety of platforms.

I recently finished with Thinkful after completing an associates degree in computer science from Bellevue College with a 4.0 GPA.

My background with Northwest Industry Leaders in restaurants gives me a unique ability to connect and communicate with the customer and provide high quality solutions on the spot.
In addition to my recent experience at Thinkful, my CS degree and a successful 20 year career in some of the top restaurants in Seattle, I am constantly seeking out new technologies or libraries to use to build my own tools and projects.

When I'm not coding, I can usually be found hiking in the woods around the Puget Sound, on my laptop preparing a D&D session and leading my players through some fantastic dungeon, or exploring the Pacific Northwest with my wife Angela. I am obsessed with lifelong learning and my current learning projects (that do not revolve around import, JWTs and APIs) include 3d-printing and finishing my first fantasy novel ‚ÄúThe Breaking.‚Äù
